    <h2>By: DrkWithT at GitHub</h2>
    <p>
        This is a self-made, _toy_ HTTP(S)/1.1 server using Java SE 18 libraries. The server will implement a working part of the HTTP/1.1 specification in _RFC 9112_, or just enough to support the most common methods and types of messages between it and a browser. This also means that not all features of HTTP/1.1 will be implemented for the sake of simplicity.
